When one variable might not be enough
- A lot of variance values are not explained by just one feature.
- Predictions are inaccurate.

Formulation of MLR

New considerations to be made when moving from SLR to MLR
- Overfitting
- Multicollinearity
- Feature selection

Dealing with categorical variables
- Dummy variables for fewer levels

Feature scaling
- Standardisation
- MinMax scaling
- Scaling for categorical variables

Model assessment and comparison
- Adjusted R-squared
- AIC, BIC

Feature selection
- Manual feature selection
- Automated feature selection
- Finding a balance between the two
