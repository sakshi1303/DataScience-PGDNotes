Machine learning models can be classified into the following three types based on the task performed and the nature of the output:

**Regression**: The output variable to be predicted is a continuous variable, e.g., the score of a student on a subject.</br>
**Classification**: The output variable to be predicted is a categorical variable, e.g., classifying incoming emails as spam or ham.</br>
**Clustering**: No predefined notion of a label is allocated to the groups/clusters formed, e.g., customer segmentation. 

Machine Learning model can be classified into - 

Supervised learning methods

Past data with labels is used for building the model.</br>
Regression and classification algorithms fall under this category.</br>

Unsupervised learning methods

No predefined labels are assigned to past data.</br>
Clustering algorithms fall under this category.</br>

Regression Line - 

y = β0 + β1x 

A simple linear regression model attempts to explain the relationship between a dependent variable and an independent one using a straight line.</br>
The independent variable is also known as the predictor variable, and the dependent variables are also known as the output variables.

Gradient descent

Gradient descent is an optimisation algorithm that optimises the objective function (cost function for linear regression) to reach the optimal solution.
