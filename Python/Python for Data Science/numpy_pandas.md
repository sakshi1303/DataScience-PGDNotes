Numpy -

- Basics
- Operations over 1-D Arrays
- Multidimensional Arrays
- Creating Numpy Arrays
- Mathematical Operations on Numpy
- Computation Times in Numpy vs Python Lists

Summary -

- Arrays, which are the basic data structure in the NumPy library
- Creating NumPy arrays from a list or a tuple
- Creating randomly large arrays which can be done using the arange command
- Analysing the shape and dimension of an array using array.shape, array.ndim and so on
- Indexing, slicing and subsetting an array, which is very similar to indexing in lists
- Working on multidimensional arrays
- Manipulating arrays using reshape(), hstack() and vstack()

Pandas -

- Basics
- Pandas-Rows and Columns
- Describing Data
- Indexing and Slicing
- Operations on Dataframes
- Groupby and Aggregate Functions
- Merging Dataframes
- Pivot Tables

Summary -

- Pandas Series and Dataframes, which are the basic data structures in the Pandas library
- Indexing, selecting and subsetting a dataframe
- Merging and appending two dataframes, which can be done using the .merge and .concat commands
- Grouping and summarising dataframes, which can be done using groupby() to first make an object and then use it to play around
- The pivot table function in a dataframe, which is similar to pivot tables in MS Excel
- Finally, you learnt how to perform different functions over time-series data using Pandas
