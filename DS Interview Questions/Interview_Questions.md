What is the advantage of NumPy arrays over lists?

- Numpys takes less amount of storage than Lists
- Mathematical Operations are easier to perform to Numpys than List i.e. np.array([1,2,3])*2
- Complex Mathematical Opers s/a mean, median can be applied
- Different functions like reshape, arrange, zeros, ones, shape can be applied.
- They are faster than List as they are built in C

I am currently working as a Data Scientist in Fidelity International. 
Current Roles and Responsibilties include data analysis, performing Exploratory Data Analysis, model selection, model building and evaluation using various evaluation metrics.

Project I -

- Situation is to predict the customer churn to a competetive firm.
- Task is to build a model with better evaluation metrics and prediction which are Accuracy, F1 score etc. (Accuracy because we have balanced dataset)
- Action taken was we started with a simple logistic regression model post EDA(data cleaning steps) where we achived the accuracy of around 72%
- Result was that we have achieved a decent model.
- Further enhancements: To apply Random Forest Model and compare the metrics where we can further tune the hyperparamaters and compare the accuracies.


Project II -

- Situation is to predict the oppurtunities of clients which are mre likely to convert into potential customers.
- Task is to build a model with better evaluation metrics and prediction
- Action taken is we that currently performing EDA, handle missing values etc and will start with model selection and model building.
