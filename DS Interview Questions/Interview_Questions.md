What is the advantage of NumPy arrays over lists?

  --Numpys takes less amount of storage than Lists
  --Mathematical Operations are easier to perform to Numpys than List i.e. np.array([1,2,3])*2
  --Complex Mathematical Opers s/a mean, median can be applied
  --Different functions like reshape, arrange, zeros, ones, shape can be applied.
  --They are faster than List as they are built in C
